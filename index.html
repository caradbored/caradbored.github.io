    <div class='snippet'><h2>Here's a snippet from Book 1 (Red) Chapter 1:</h2>
    <p>Floating a metre and a half above the floor was a small ball of red flames. It lit up the bricks on either side with a pulsating glow, small tongues of fire flickering upwards every couple of seconds, and something about it, something extra unnatural, had Ayla completely transfixed. She took a few steps closer, and raised her hand to reach out for it. 
      <br />Isabel’s eyes widened in surprise. “Ayla, what are you doing?” 
      <br /><br />“I… can feel it calling me closer.” She spoke without breaking her gaze on the orb.
      <br /><br />“What if it kills you?” That might’ve been a bit too harsh.
      <br /><br />“I can feel it. It doesn’t want to.”
      <br /><br />“And if that’s just what it wants you to think? Don’t get yourself killed because a magic… thing… said you’d be fine!”
      <br /><br />Ayla didn’t reply to that. She knew that neither of them were going to change their minds, and she knew that if there was ever a time to trust her gut, it was right now. Taking another step towards it, the light’s rhythmic pulsing sped up, now in time with the rapid thumping of her heartbeat, the ends of the individual flames starting to lean towards her approaching hand. They stretched further and further as she came closer, until the tip of her index finger finally made contact, and the entire ball of energy erupted in a powerful blast. </p>
